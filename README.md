**Hospital Management System**

Welcome to the Hospital Management System! This system is designed to streamline the management of patients, doctors, and appointments within a hospital environment. It consists of five modules: Add Patient, View Patients, View Doctors, Book Appointment, and Exit. Below is a brief overview of each module:

### Add Patient
This module allows hospital staff to add new patients to the system. Staff can input essential details such as patient name, age and gender. This information is crucial for maintaining accurate records and providing appropriate medical care.

### View Patients
In this module, staff can view a list of all patients currently registered in the system. This feature provides an overview of the patient population within the hospital and allows staff to access individual patient profiles for further details or updates.

### View Doctors
The View Doctors module displays a list of all doctors associated with the hospital. This includes their names and specialization. Having easy access to this information facilitates the scheduling of appointments and ensures that patients are directed to the appropriate medical professionals.

### Book Appointment
This module enables staff to schedule appointments for patients with their preferred doctors. Users can select a patient from the existing records, choose a suitable doctor from the available options, specify the date of the appointment. Efficient appointment booking is essential for managing the hospital's daily operations and providing timely medical services to patients.

### Exit
The Exit module allows users to exit the Hospital Management System once they have completed their tasks. This ensures a clean and orderly termination of the application, maintaining system integrity and security.
